# jodamaso-portfolio
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Description
This portfolio was my first attempt at using react. Really amazed with what react can do in terms of SPA and speed. I plan on updating this once I learn more about using react!

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.
